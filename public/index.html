	<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">C</span>hris Faulkner’s energy expertise is in question. In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him and his Dallas company, Breitling Energy Corp., of misleading investors with over-inflated return estimates, faulty science and intertwined companies to keep it all lowkey. While the government’s accusations have not yet reached the courtroom, about a dozen people spoke with The Dallas Morning News about their observations of Faulkner and the lifestyle he appeared to live. Investors said Faulkner’s frequent appearances on FOX Business Network, CNN, The New York Times and this newspaper, as well as radio advertisements that aired in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, informed some of their decisions to invest in Breitling Energy.</p>

        <p class="lede">Chris Faulkner&rsquo;s magazine covers and industry accolades hung from the walls of Breitling Energy&rsquo;s corporate offices on Pacific Avenue in downtown Dallas. Today, those walls lay bare, the emptiness calling attention to Faulkner&rsquo;s rise and potential fall from the oil and gas big leagues.</span> </p>

        <p>In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Faulkner and some of his Breitling colleagues embellished to investors the potential returns on wells they drilled. Faulkner, the government alleges, duped consumers by skewing geological projections to more easily entice investments. Federal officials filed lawsuits against the company and Faulkner in June, and the FBI seized his Bentley Continental and Aston Martin Virage in July. </p>

        <p>Faulkner didn&rsquo;t get his start in the oil business. In the 1990s, Faulkner launched C I Host, a Bedford-based internet company that provides website management solutions to companies. By the early 2000s, the company was at the center of lawsuits challenging its reputation. In one case, Microsoft sued the company for not paying fees. The dispute was later settled.</p>

        <p>He founded Southwest Energy Exploration LLC in 2004, and changed the name to Breitling Energy in 2010.</p>

        <p>Faulkner&rsquo;s evolution is well documented. His dealings in politics and history with lawsuits have been noted by Texas publications. Private citizens have kept tabs as well. Even after unflattering exposes, Faulkner continued to be invited back to CNN, FOX Business Network, the BBC and others.</p>

        <div class="videoBlock">
          <h6>Here’s Chris Faulkner on FOX Business Network’s Stuart Varney’s show. He answers Varney’s questions about whether drilling companies can afford to operate in the economic conditions of the time.</h6>

        <p>The mechanisms Faulkner deployed to meet consumers are nothing new. Routinized hype is a 19th Century concept. Beneath the layers of marketing and advertising rest public relations specialists, professionals trained in consumer behavior and media patterns.</p>

        <p>In 2013, Faulkner hired his publicist. It was the Ann L. Stephenson Group, based in New Jersey. Ann Stephenson, co-owner of the former group, said Faulkner and her team pursued interviews by sending news releases and emails to news outlets. Faulkner and Breitling bought radio advertisements and newspapers ads.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;He was looking for a PR group, and he was an excellent spokesman,&rdquo; Stephenson said. The team was assembled.</p>

        <p>At roundtable discussions and in on-air debates, Faulkner took the lead for the industry. He even criticized the industry&rsquo;s tactics on several occasions. For someone who, according to the SEC, hadn&rsquo;t any real experience in the industry, he played the part. He could be seen wearing pinstriped suits and cowboys boots. In a segment for The Weather Channel, Faulkner was on a drill site somewhere in West Texas answering questions about fracking and a recent spate of earthquakes.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s early in the game to blame fracking or to blame the oil industry,&rdquo; he said.</p>

        <p>Faulkner was live from Austin, New York, Los Angeles, Saudia Arabia, Dallas. He predicted &mdash; quite often accurately &mdash; how the oil market would react and change. Journalists asked him to weigh in on environmental debates from Denton to Balcombe, U.K. </p>

        <p>What stood out the most about Faulkner, reporters say, was his willingness to be quoted. The press could reach him on his cellphone.</p>

        <p>According to a handful of investors, his appearances in news media led them to trust Breitling. John Atkins and Jim Cary, both investors, said their returns in recent months have been disappointing. </p>

        <p>Faulkner&rsquo;s reputation as an expert can be traced to the Oil and Gas Monitor, a trade publication which earned him the title of Frack Master. Faulkner had 29 bylines in the magazine. In 2012, he wrote a piece, &ldquo;Oil and Gas Best Kept Secrets: Secrets of Oil and Gas Investments for the Average Individual,&rdquo; which served as guide on how not to be misled by energy companies.</p>

        <p>Faulkner suggested to Stephenson they finance a movie, &ldquo;Breaking Free,&rdquo; which explored the basics of hydraulic fracturing. The movie features scientists, oil and gas researchers, Texas politicians and families who said they&rsquo;d benefitted from companies drilling on their land.</p>

        <p>Stephenson said she approached Faulkner about publishing a book &mdash; &ldquo;it could really set you on the top,&rdquo; she recalled telling him. Faulkner agreed. &ldquo;The Fracking Truth: America&rsquo;s Energy Revolution: the Inside, Untold Story&rdquo; serves as the Frack Master&rsquo;s gospel. In it, one can find some of the same arguments he made in articles and TV news segments broadcasted around the world.</p>

        <p>Faulkner&rsquo;s nickname was used by reporters introducing him to their audiences. Richard Quest, a CNN anchor, even highlighted the significance of the title in January while doing a segment with Faulkner. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;The Frack Master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that name will stick with you forever.&rdquo;</p>

        <div class="videoBlock">
          <h6>On CNN, Richard Quest asks Chris Faulkner about how volatility in the Middle East affects Americans at the gas pump. Faulkner was routine guest of Quest’s show.</h6>

        </div>

        <p>From 2012 to 2015, Breitling paid for radio advertisements on KRLD, CBS&rsquo;s Dallas-Fort Worth station, called &ldquo;Oil &amp; Gas Today,&rdquo; a KRLD employee said. During the slots, Faulkner pushed some of the same lines he did on TV and in his book and movie.In December, a Dallas County judge ordered Breitling to pay CBS Radion Texas Inc.$172,768 in actual damages after the company failed to pay the station for the ads.</p>

        <p>Faulkner co-hosted a radio show called Powering America. According to Breitling&rsquo;s website, the show ran on Business 1110 KTEK. According to Salem Media Group&rsquo;s website, however, the show ran on News Talk 1070 AM KNTH Houston. Multiple calls to Salem Media Group trying to clear up the discrepancy went unanswered until Chuck Jewell, a general manager at Salem, returned calls to decline comment. He deferred questions to the company&rsquo;s lawyers.   Stephenson said she was not the only person sharing the word about the Frack Master.</p>

        <p>George McQuade is the director of global marketing and public relations for Mayo Communications, a marketing company he said his wife owns. The firm, according to its website, did work for Breitling Energy. And C I Host is listed as a client.</p>

        <p>McQuade is also a journalist who has written pieces about Faulkner&rsquo;s book, movie and arguments in the press. </p>

        <p>&ldquo;Breitling Energy has become a national voice for responsible American energy development and is recognized as an energy industry leader for effectively communicating its message,&rdquo; Mr. McQuade writes.</p>

        <p>Reached over the phone, McQuade said he was unclear when he was working for Faulkner as a marketer and when he wrote about him as a journalist. </p>

        <p>He did, however, say Faulkner was a client until March 2015. Datelines on McQuade&rsquo;s Examiner stories about Faulkner&rsquo;s public reputation are marked April 2015.</p>

        <p> &ldquo;It could have been during or after,&rdquo; McQuade said. He declined to comment further. </p>

        <p>Mr. Faulkner did not comment for this article, but some of the people who worked with and for him described him as a nice guy. He&rsquo;d always remember your name. The company Christmas parties were nights to remember; gold-painted women and dwarves entertained the Breitling staff. </p>

        <p>After reading an article in The News about the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, Joe Simo, the geologist who allegedly fudged the numbers, commented on the post, defending himself. He even left his phone number for reporters to follow. In his office, he opened up. He shared everything. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate to answer questions. Simo remembered &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; of plaques honoring Faulkner inside the company&rsquo;s headquarters.</p>

        <p>"Faulkner is a very intelligent guy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have no problem saying that. This is just greed.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Faulkner didn&rsquo;t get his start in the oil business. In the 1990s, Faulkner launched C I Host, a Bedford-based internet company that provides website management solutions to companies. By the early 2000s, the company was at the center of lawsuits challenging its reputation. In one case, Microsoft sued the company for not paying fees. The dispute was later settled.</p>

            <p>He founded Southwest Energy Exploration LLC in 2004, and changed the name to Breitling Energy in 2010.</p>

            <p>Faulkner&rsquo;s evolution is well documented. His dealings in politics and history with lawsuits have been noted by Texas publications. Private citizens have kept tabs as well. Even after unflattering exposes, Faulkner continued to be invited back to CNN, FOX Business Network, the BBC and others.</p>

            <p>The mechanisms Faulkner deployed to meet consumers are nothing new. Routinized hype is a 19th Century concept. Beneath the layers of marketing and advertising rest public relations specialists, professionals trained in consumer behavior and media patterns.</p>

            <p>In 2013, Faulkner hired his publicist. It was the Ann L. Stephenson Group, based in New Jersey. Ann Stephenson, co-owner of the former group, said Faulkner and her team pursued interviews by sending news releases and emails to news outlets. Faulkner and Breitling bought radio advertisements and newspapers ads.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;He was looking for a PR group, and he was an excellent spokesman,&rdquo; Stephenson said. The team was assembled.</p>

            <p>At roundtable discussions and in on-air debates, Faulkner took the lead for the industry. He even criticized the industry&rsquo;s tactics on several occasions. For someone who, according to the SEC, hadn&rsquo;t any real experience in the industry, he played the part. He could be seen wearing pinstriped suits and cowboys boots. In a segment for The Weather Channel, Faulkner was on a drill site somewhere in West Texas answering questions about fracking and a recent spate of earthquakes.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s early in the game to blame fracking or to blame the oil industry,&rdquo; he said.</p>

            <p>Faulkner was live from Austin, New York, Los Angeles, Saudia Arabia, Dallas. He predicted &mdash; quite often accurately &mdash; how the oil market would react and change. Journalists asked him to weigh in on environmental debates from Denton to Balcombe, U.K. </p>

            <p>What stood out the most about Faulkner, reporters say, was his willingness to be quoted. The press could reach him on his cellphone.</p>

                <h5>Common arguments</h5><br />

                <div class="headshot"></div>

                <h6>The Oil Renaissance</h6>
                <p>Faulkner talked about how West Texas has become a booming oil field. That’s because, as Faulkner and others argue, it’s more profitable for companies to drill in the Permian Basin. A graph in “The Fracking Debate” shows a comparison.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <h6>“Be careful what you wish for.”</h6>
                <p>Faulkner used this to illustrate the double-edge sword of low gas prices. On one hand, consumers paying less for gas can spend more money elsewhere, like on rent or groceries. On the other hand, oil field workers are laid off, which means they and their families have less money to spend on necessities.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <h6>Energy independence</h6>
                <p>Consumers will hear this concept from politicians, industry executives and academics alike. The world is a market for energy; there is virtually nobody who doesn’t rely on energy. So whether that’s energy from coal or energy from oil, people need it. And in the global race to be on top, energy plays a big role. It’s a good idea, some argue, for a nation to be able to support itself from global turmoil that could cause the global energy market to fluctuate.</p>

            <p>According to a handful of investors, his appearances in news media led them to trust Breitling. John Atkins and Jim Cary, both investors,said their returns in recent months have been disappointing. </p>

            <p>Faulkner&rsquo;s reputation as an expert can be traced to the Oil and Gas Monitor, a trade publication which earned him the title of Frack Master. Faulkner had 29 bylines in the magazine. In 2012, he wrote a piece, &ldquo;Oil and Gas Best Kept Secrets: Secrets of Oil and Gas Investments for the Average Individual,&rdquo; which served as guide on how not to be misled by energy companies.</p>

            <p>Faulkner suggested to Stephenson they finance a movie, &ldquo;Breaking Free,&rdquo; which explored the basics of hydraulic fracturing. The movie features scientists, oil and gas researchers, Texas politicians and families who said they&rsquo;d benefitted from companies drilling on their land.</p>

            <p>Stephenson said she approached Faulkner about publishing a book &mdash; &ldquo;it could really set you on the top,&rdquo; she recalled telling him. Faulkner agreed. &ldquo;The Fracking Truth: America&rsquo;s Energy Revolution: the Inside, Untold Story&rdquo; serves as the Frack Master&rsquo;s gospel. In it, one can find some of the same arguments he made in articles and TV news segments broadcasted around the world.</p>

            <p>Faulkner&rsquo;s nickname was used by reporters introducing him to their audiences. Richard Quest, a CNN anchor, even highlighted the significance of the title in January while doing a segment with Faulkner. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;The Frack Master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that name will stick with you forever.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>From 2012 to 2015, Breitling paid for radio advertisements on KRLD, CBS&rsquo;s Dallas-Fort Worth station, called &ldquo;Oil &amp; Gas Today,&rdquo; a KRLD employee said. During the slots, Faulkner pushed some of the same lines he did on TV and in his book and movie.In December, a Dallas County judge ordered Breitling to pay CBS Radion Texas Inc.$172,768 in actual damages after the company failed to pay the station for the ads.</p>

            <p>Faulkner co-hosted a radio show called Powering America. According to Breitling&rsquo;s website, the show ran on Business 1110 KTEK. According to Salem Media Group&rsquo;s website, however, the show ran on News Talk 1070 AM KNTH Houston. Multiple calls to Salem Media Group trying to clear up the discrepancy went unanswered until Chuck Jewell, a general manager at Salem, returned calls to decline comment. He deferred questions to the company&rsquo;s lawyers.   Stephenson said she was not the only person sharing the word about the Frack Master.</p>

                <p>Below is the $241,752 of media attention (free media) Faulkner received since 2012. Free media is an indication of how often a brand was circulating in mass media without paying for it. (Source: Mediaquant)</p>

            <p>George McQuade is the director of global marketing and public relations for Mayo Communications, a marketing company he said his wife owns. The firm, according to its website, did work for Breitling Energy. And C I Host is listed as a client.</p>

            <p>McQuade is also a journalist who has written pieces about Faulkner&rsquo;s book, movie and arguments in the press. </p>

            <p>&ldquo;Breitling Energy has become a national voice for responsible American energy development and is recognized as an energy industry leader for effectively communicating its message,&rdquo; Mr. McQuade writes.</p>

            <p>Reached over the phone, McQuade said he was unclear when he was working for Faulkner as a marketer and when he wrote about him as a journalist. </p>

            <p>He did, however, say Faulkner was a client until March 2015. Datelines on McQuade&rsquo;s Examiner stories about Faulkner&rsquo;s public reputation are marked April 2015.</p>

            <p> &ldquo;It could have been during or after,&rdquo; McQuade said. He declined to comment further. </p>

            <p>Mr. Faulkner did not comment for this article, but some of the people who worked with and for him described him as a nice guy. He&rsquo;d always remember your name. The company Christmas parties were nights to remember; gold-painted women and dwarves entertained the Breitling staff. </p>

            <p>After reading an article in The News about the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, Joe Simo, the geologist who allegedly fudged the numbers, commented on the post, defending himself. He even left his phone number for reporters to follow. In his office, he opened up. He shared everything. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate to answer questions. Simo remembered &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; of plaques honoring Faulkner inside the company&rsquo;s headquarters.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Faulkner is a very intelligent guy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have no problem saying that. This is just greed.&rdquo;</p>

            <p class="lede">Chris Faulkner&rsquo;s magazine covers and industry accolades hung from the walls of Breitling Energy&rsquo;s corporate offices on Pacific Avenue in downtown Dallas. Today, those walls lay bare, the emptiness calling attention to Faulkner&rsquo;s rise and potential fall from the oil and gas big leagues.</span> </p>

            <p>In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Faulkner and some of his Breitling colleagues embellished to investors the potential returns on wells they drilled. Faulkner, the government alleges, duped consumers by skewing geological projections to more easily entice investments. Federal officials filed lawsuits against the company and Faulkner in June, and the FBI seized his Bentley Continental and Aston Martin Virage in July. </p>

            <p>Faulkner didn&rsquo;t get his start in the oil business. In the 1990s, Faulkner launched C I Host, a Bedford-based internet company that provides website management solutions to companies. By the early 2000s, the company was at the center of lawsuits challenging its reputation. In one case, Microsoft sued the company for not paying fees. The dispute was later settled.</p>

            <p>He founded Southwest Energy Exploration LLC in 2004, and changed the name to Breitling Energy in 2010.</p>

            <p>Faulkner&rsquo;s evolution is well documented. His dealings in politics and history with lawsuits have been noted by Texas publications. Private citizens have kept tabs as well. Even after unflattering exposes, Faulkner continued to be invited back to CNN, FOX Business Network, the BBC and others.</p>

            <p>The mechanisms Faulkner deployed to meet consumers are nothing new. Routinized hype is a 19th Century concept. Beneath the layers of marketing and advertising rest public relations specialists, professionals trained in consumer behavior and media patterns.</p>

            <p>In 2013, Faulkner hired his publicist. It was the Ann L. Stephenson Group, based in New Jersey. Ann Stephenson, co-owner of the former group, said Faulkner and her team pursued interviews by sending news releases and emails to news outlets.
