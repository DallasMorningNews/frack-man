        <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow tech entrepreneur Chris Faulkner transformed himself into the oilfield &ldquo;Frack Master&rdquo; is a story of how news outlets become unwitting accessories in promoting expert reputations. It&rsquo;s also a cautionary tale with warnings about what consumers can do to spot puffery while it&rsquo;s happening.</p>

        <p class="intro">Until May, Faulkner&rsquo;s magazine covers and industry accolades hung from the walls of Breitling Energy&rsquo;s corporate offices on Pacific Avenue in downtown Dallas. They were part of an intensively planned media campaign to create the persona that made Faulkner one of the most called-upon guests of major network business shows.</p>

        <p class="intro">But today, those walls lay bare, their emptiness calling attention to Faulkner&rsquo;s sudden rise and spectacular fall from the oil and gas big leagues.</p>

            <h3>U.S. <span style="text-transform: lowercase">v.</span> Faulkner</h3>
            <h1>Reaping fame’s reward,<br /> then facing the penalty</h1>
            <hr noshade />
            <h4>“The investors were happy when oil prices were high. When prices came down, investors became unhappy and blamed [Faulkner].”</h4>
            <h5>— Larry Friedman, a Dallas attorney representing Faulkner</h5>
        </div>


    </div>
    <section class="contentWell clearFix" id="story2">

        <p class="lede">The implosion ended in June, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Faulkner and his Breitling colleagues of pulling off an $80 million fraud by embellishing the returns they could deliver to investors on wells they drilled.</p>

        <p>The government also alleges that Faulkner spent at least $30 million in investor funds to support his &ldquo;lifestyle of decadence and debauchery&rdquo; that included &ldquo;lavish meals and entertainment, international travel, cars, jewelry, gentlemen&rsquo;s clubs and personal escorts.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Faulkner&rsquo;s frequent media appearances were key in his ability to convince investors he was trustworthy, the SEC alleged in court filings.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;As soon as [Breitling] began offering investments in oil and gas prospects, Faulkner misrepresented his education, experience and background,&rdquo; government lawyers wrote in laying out their case. &ldquo; He represented that he had extensive and diverse experience &lsquo;in all aspects of oil and gas operations,&rsquo; when he had no such experience.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Efforts to reach Faulkner were unsuccessful. His attorney, Larry Friedman of Dallas, commented on his behalf.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The investors were happy when oil prices were high,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When prices came down, investors became unhappy and blamed [Faulkner]. He may be one of the most notable, but not the only one. You get the reward for being a public figure, but you also pay the penalty.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The reward lasted for a while. From 2012 to 2016, Faulkner regularly popped up on CNBC, CNN, Fox Business and the BBC as a knowledgeable Texas oilman willing to comment on the day&rsquo;s energy market happenings.</p>

        <div class="videoBlock">
          <h6>Here’s Chris Faulkner on Fox Business Network’s <span style="font-style: italic">Varney &amp; Co.</span> show. He answers Stuart Varney’s questions about whether drilling companies can afford to operate in the economic conditions of the time.</h6>

        <p>Those appearances carried a value of $241,752 in &ldquo;free media&rdquo; for Faulkner, according to research firm Mediaquant. That&rsquo;s what it would have cost Faulkner to buy advertising equal to his broadcast time.</p>

    <p>Unlike many of Texas&rsquo; legacy oilmen, Faulkner didn&rsquo;t get his start in the oil business. He began in the 1990s with C I Host, a Bedford website data hosting company. Faulkner no longer works for the company, which had oil and gas firms as customers. Website hosting provided Faulkner with &ldquo;his only exposure to the oil and gas industry,&rdquo; according to the SEC.</p>

    <p>By 2004, records show, Faulkner founded Southwest Energy Exploration LLC. In 2010, the company&rsquo;s name changed to Breitling.</p>

    <p>Faulkner won the &ldquo;Frack Master&rdquo; nickname from the trade publication Oil &amp; Gas Monitor. He wrote for the publication as well. In 2012, he bylined a piece titled &ldquo;Oil and Gas Best Kept Secrets: Secrets of Oil and Gas Investments for the Average Individual,&rdquo; which offered, ironically, a guide on how not to be misled by energy companies.</p>

    <p>The memorable moniker was used consistently by news anchors introducing him to their audiences. CNN anchor Richard Quest highlighted its significance in January during a segment with Faulkner.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The Frack Master,&rdquo; Quest said, &ldquo;that name will stick with you forever.&rdquo;</p>

                <h1>A movie, book and accessibility combine to create a go-to guest</h1>
                <hr noshade />
                <h4>“Faulkner is a very intelligent guy. I have no problem saying that. This is just greed.”</h4>
                <h5>— Joe Simo, the geologist accused by the SEC of providing bad science to investors</h5>

        <section class="contentWell clearFix" id="story3">

            <p class="lede">The mechanisms Faulkner deployed to become a go-to guest are time-proven. Beneath the layers of marketing and advertising rest public relations specialists, professionals trained in consumer behavior and media patterns.</p>

            <p>Around 2012, Faulkner hired a publicist, the New Jersey-based Ann L. Stephenson Group.</p>

            <p>Ann Stephenson, co-owner of the former agency, said Faulkner and her team formed a well-organized, aggressive pursuit of media interviews by sending news releases and emails to news outlets. Faulkner and Breitling also bought advertisements on the radio and in newspapers.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;He was looking for a PR group, and he was an excellent spokesman,&rdquo; Stephenson said.</p>

            <aside class="factBox sideBlock leftBlock">

                <h5>Common arguments</h5><br />

                <div class="headshot"></div>

                <h6>The oil renaissance</h6>
                <p>Faulkner talked about how West Texas has become a booming oil field. That’s because, as Faulkner and others argue, it’s more profitable for companies to drill in the Permian Basin. A graph in “The Fracking Debate” shows a comparison.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <h6>“Be careful what you wish for”</h6>
                <p>Faulkner used this to illustrate the double-edge sword of low gas prices. On one hand, consumers paying less for gas can spend more money elsewhere, like on rent or groceries. On the other hand, oilfield workers are laid off, which means they and their families have less money to spend on necessities.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <h6>Energy independence</h6>
                <p>Consumers will hear this concept from politicians, industry executives and academics alike. The world is a market for energy; there is virtually nobody who doesn’t rely on energy. So whether that’s energy from coal or energy from oil, people need it. And in the global race to be on top, energy plays a big role. It’s a good idea, some argue, for a nation to be support its own energy needs to cushion itself from global turmoil and fluctuating prices.</p>

            </aside>
            <!-- end left fact box -->

            <p>They tried several strategies.</p>

            <p>Stephenson said Faulkner suggested they produce a film exploring the basics of hydraulic fracturing. During winter 2013, Faulkner hired veteran filmmaker Robin Bossert to direct <span style="font-style: italic"><a href="http://breakingfreemovie.com/about-the-film.html">Breaking Free: The Shale Rock Revolution.</a></span> By summer 2014, the movie was edited and ready for release.</p>

            <p>The movie features scientists, oil and gas researchers, Texas politicians and families who said they&rsquo;d benefited from companies drilling on their land. It is available online, including on iTunes, Amazon and Google Play. The film did not reach theaters. Bossert said the documentary was rejected by every film festival except the Boston Film Festival.</p>

            <p>Stephenson said she also suggested to Faulkner that he publish a book.</p>

            <p>Faulkner agreed and began assembling <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-fracking-truth-chris-faulkner/1119951675#productInfoTabs"><span style="font-style: italic">The Fracking Truth: America&rsquo;s Energy Revolution: The Inside, Untold Story</span></a> in 2012. The hardback took about two years to finish. In it, he laid out some of the same arguments he made in TV news segments aired around the world.</p>

            <p>From 2012 to 2015, Breitling bought ads that ran three times a day during the weekdays on KRLD-AM (1080), CBS&rsquo; Dallas-Fort Worth radio station, for his &ldquo;Oil &amp; Gas Today&rdquo; segments. Faulkner gave short commentary about energy reports and other industry news, as well as explanations of fracking.</p>

            <p>When he made it to TV, he played his Texas oilman role to the hilt, wearing pinstriped suits and cowboy boots. In a segment for The Weather Channel, Faulkner stood on a drill site somewhere in West Texas answering questions about fracking and a recent spate of earthquakes.</p>

            <p>Joe Simo was Breitling&rsquo;s in-house geologist. He said Faulkner had a pretty good grasp of the business, even as prices were crashing.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Faulkner is a very intelligent guy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have no problem saying that. This is just greed.&rdquo; </p>

            <div class="chart-wrapper">
                <h5>Faulkner's free media</h5>
                <p>Below is the $241,752 of media attention (free media) Faulkner received since 2012. Free media is an indication of how often a brand was circulating in mass media without paying for it.</p>

            </div>


            <p>The SEC cited Simo as well as Faulkner for fraud. The agency says Simo hugely fudged oil well production forecasts. Simo blames Faulkner for enticing investors. No matter who produced the forecasts, many wells delivered less than 10 percent of what investors had been told.</p>

            <p>The company finances unraveled faster than Faulkner&rsquo;s media-driven reputation. In December, months before the government accused it of being a fraud, a Dallas County judge ordered Breitling to pay $172,768 to CBS Radio Texas Inc. for failing to pay KRLD for the ads. </p>

                <hr noshade />
                <h4>“We throw the word ‘expert’ around pretty easily because we want our stories to carry more weight. It’s really incumbent on the media to do these checks as well, to make sure [we’re] not contributing to somebody else building themselves.”</h4>

            <p class="lede">Faulkner succeeded as an industry expert for as long as he did in part because it wasn&rsquo;t all fake. He predicted, quite often accurately, how the oil market would react and change.</p>

            <p>Oil and gas researchers interviewed for this story found many of Faulkner&rsquo;s statements in the news media to be simplistic but accurate, or not far off the mark.</p>

            <p>He called for &ldquo;a North American version of OPEC&rdquo; to more effectively compete with the Saudis and influence global oil markets. As production in the Middle East rose, rigs in the U.S. stopped drilling, leading to layoffs and dwindling gas prices.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Be careful what you wish for,&rdquo; Faulkner often said, referring to how low oil prices help Americans but hurt the industry.</p>

            <p><span class="font-style: italic">The Wall Street Journal</span>, on Aug. 11, monitored oil production in Saudi Arabia with a front-page story headlined, &ldquo;Saudi Output Hits Record.&rdquo; It chronicled a market share race among &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s biggest oil producers,&rdquo; identical to much of Faulkner&rsquo;s own commentary.</p>

            <p>Terrance Suber, a marketing professor at the University of North Texas, teaches students on how to be remembered. Because people do business with people they trust, a solid foundation in building your brand is a must, he said.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;If you tell someone a story people can relate to, that&rsquo;s how you connect with people and build a following,&rdquo; said Suber, who has worked for firms including Coca-Cola Co.</p>

            <p>Faulkner did a good job telling a relatable story. His media appearances often guided viewers and readers through sensitive environmental debates on fracking or fluctuating prices at the gas pump. Marketers call this connection &ldquo;the point of pain for the consumer,&rdquo; Suber said.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;And before you know it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve built your personal r&eacute;sum&eacute; as an expert or a thought leader, if you will.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Jacqueline Lambiase, director of strategic communication at Texas Christian University, said it&rsquo;s important for consumers to understand they have a say in determining the value of a message &mdash; be it from a firm or a journalist.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The access barriers to books and movies have fallen to a very low level,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think the public&rsquo;s understanding of that has not caught up yet. It&rsquo;s much easier to produce a movie. &#8230; It&rsquo;s much easier to publish a book. When we seen those slick productions, part of what we think as consumers is, well, all these people are involved and they must have vetted this guy. It has the appearance of legitimacy, yet there is nothing behind the facade.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Even after reports began to surface in late 2014 about <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-promoter-sues-hard-partying-oilman-unpaid-bills-article-1.2387294">Faulkner&rsquo;s troubles</a> and <a href="http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2014/09/uk-agency-orders-brietling-energy-to-stop-pro-fracking-ad-campaign.html/">Breitling&rsquo;s own run-ins</a>, he continued to be invited back by national news networks and quoted by The New York Times.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;The media doesn&rsquo;t always do its homework either,&rdquo; said Mark Horvit, director of Investigative Reporters and Editors, an educational resource for journalists. &ldquo;We throw the word expert around pretty easily because we want our stories to carry more weight. It&rsquo;s really incumbent on the media to do these checks as well.&rdquo; </p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <section class="contentWell clearFix" id="story4">

                <p class="lede">Mass media scholars and journalists say if a news story doesn&rsquo;t spell out exactly what makes the person an expert, look that up yourself.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Some people are just really good at marketing themselves,&rdquo; Horvit said. &ldquo;The showier somebody is, the harder they work to promote themselves, the harder you should look at them.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Environmental activist Sharon Wilson did just that. In summer 2014, while living in Denton, her town became the epicenter of a national debate on the community fallout from fracking.</p>

                <p>Denton was the first city in the United States to ban fracking within its municipal limits. (The ban was later reversed by the Texas Legislature, which passed a law stripping cities of the right to outlaw activities that the state considers legal.)</p>

                <p>Faulkner showed up at a City Council meeting to speak on behalf of the oil and gas industry. At first glance, Wilson said, she could tell Faulkner wasn&rsquo;t a resident. He arrived to the council chambers earlier than most, Wilson said, and took up a whole row of seats. But most of all, Wilson remembered Faulkner&rsquo;s nice shoes, which seemed out of place.</p>

                <p>So she watched him throughout the night.</p>

                <p>When she got home the next morning, after hours of debate, Wilson began looking into his background. Later that year, around December, she published a blog post that questioned whether Faulkner was as experienced in the energy industry as he and others claimed him to be.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.texassharon.com/2014/12/27/chris-faulkner-of-breitling-energy-who-are-you/">&ldquo;Chris Faulkner of Breitling Energy: Who are you?&rdquo;</a> one headline asked.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I got the distinct impression that no one in the industry would touch him with a 10-foot pole,&rdquo; she said.</p>

                <div class="videoBlock">
                  <h6>Chris Faulkner debates with Ewa Jasiewicz about hydraulic fracturing on Channel 4 News in London. Faulkner frequently clashed with activists and energy companies about the drilling technique.</h6>
                  <div class="videoWrapper">
                        <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqSFE6uyIXY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                  </div>
                </div>

                <p>Her blog posts about Faulkner&rsquo;s career and legal battles landed her in court. Faulkner sued her. It took almost two years, but eventually Faulkner&rsquo;s suit was thrown out. Wilson was awarded $10,000 in legal fees, though she said she hasn&rsquo;t seen the money.</p>

                <p>She continues, even now, to keep tabs on Faulkner. With each development in the fraud case, another update is posted to <a href="http://www.texassharon.com/">her blog</a>.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;It was the media who embraced him,&rdquo; Wilson said. &ldquo;I found that rather irritating, because there are people out there who they can contact who are legitimately experts.&rdquo;</p>
